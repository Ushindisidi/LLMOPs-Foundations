1. Development
Purpose: This is where the core work of building and refining the chatbot model happens. It includes coding the application logic and preparing data for model fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

Stakeholders: Primarily AI/ML Engineers and Data Scientists.

2. Deployment
Purpose: The process of taking the developed chatbot and making it available to end-users. This phase uses CI/CD pipelines to ensure a smooth, automated, and repeatable deployment.

Stakeholders: AI/ML Engineers, DevOps, and Cloud Infrastructure Teams.

3. Monitoring & Logging
Purpose: Continuously observing the live chatbot for performance issues, errors, and security risks. We track metrics like latency, error rates, and a critical task: flagging PII to prevent data leaks.

Stakeholders: AI/ML Engineers, Product Managers, and Security/Compliance Teams.

4. Evaluation & Feedback Loop
Purpose: Analyzing chatbot performance based on monitoring data and user feedback. This phase is crucial for identifying areas for improvement, like wrong answers or confusing responses.

Stakeholders: Product Managers, AI/ML Engineers, and User Support Teams.

5. Versioning & Rollback
Purpose: Managing different versions of the chatbot and its underlying model. This ensures we can quickly revert to a stable, previously working version in case of a critical bug or "AI incident" in a new release.

Stakeholders: AI/ML Engineers and DevOps Teams.

6. Improvement
Purpose: Acting on insights from evaluation and feedback. This could involve retraining the model, updating prompts, or making changes to the application logic to enhance performance, safety, or accuracy.

Stakeholders: AI/ML Engineers and Data Scientists.
