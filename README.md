# LLMOps Foundations: Chatbot Project
## üéØ Objective
This project lays the foundation for a practical LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) framework for a customer-facing chatbot at a SaaS startup. The goal is to evolve the product from a simple launch to a robust, safe, and scalable application by implementing key concepts like monitoring, versioning, evaluation, and feedback loops.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The project is structured to mirror a typical development environment:

src/: Contains the core Python scripts for the chatbot's operational components.

docs/: Holds documentation and diagrams, including the LLMOps lifecycle map.

README.md: The central project document, providing an overview, setup instructions, and design decisions.

requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python dependencies for the project.

## üìà LLMOps Lifecycle
The chatbot's lifecycle is designed for continuous improvement and reliability. It follows a flow of development, deployment, monitoring, and evaluation, all supported by feedback and versioning systems.

A detailed diagram and explanation of this lifecycle can be found in docs/lifecycle_map.md.

## üíª Code Usage
Monitoring Script (src/monitoring.py)
The monitoring.py script simulates a live monitoring system for the chatbot. It processes a series of mock log entries to:

Track Latency: Measures the time it takes to process each log entry.

Detect Errors: Flags any logs that contain "ERROR."

Flag PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Uses regular expressions to detect common privacy risks, such as emails and phone numbers.

How to Run:

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

Run the script from your terminal:

```Bash

python src/monitoring.py
```
The output will be printed to the console, showing the results of the monitoring checks.

## üîÑ Versioning & Disaster Recovery
My project uses a simple branch-based versioning strategy to ensure quick and reliable rollbacks.

main branch: This is the primary development branch. New features and hotfixes are merged here.

stable branch: This branch represents the last known good, production-ready state of the application. It is the designated target for rollbacks.

Rollback Procedure
In the event of an "AI incident" or a critical bug on the main branch, we can quickly revert to the last stable version.

Steps to Rollback:

Stop the current deployment that is running the buggy code from the main branch.

Checkout the stable branch to get the last working code.
```bash
git checkout stable
```
Redeploy the application using the code from the stable branch. This immediately restores the service to a functional state.

Investigate the bug on a separate feature branch, fix it, and merge the fix back into main after it has been thoroughly tested.

## üîí Compliance and Privacy Checklist

This project lays the groundwork for handling key compliance requirements, particularly related to PII and data privacy.

-   **PII Detection:** We use a monitoring script with regex to automatically detect and flag sensitive data like emails and phone numbers. In a production system, this would trigger an alert and potential data redaction.
-   **Data Retention:** A policy should be implemented to automatically purge old logs and feedback records to comply with regulations like GDPR.
-   **Anonymization:** A future step would be to automatically anonymize or redact PII before it is logged to a persistent store.
-   **Data Security:** While this demo uses a simple JSON file, a production system would require logs and feedback to be stored in a secure, encrypted, and access-controlled database.
